Concept design to demonstrate the usage of the following technologies:
- Clean Architecture
- Host Builder
- Blazor
- Xamarin
- SignalR

The system will keep track of real time status of various devices such as Drones, Cars, Planes, Ships etc. Tracked devices will be sending device data to the backend server and this server will push the data to Web (Blazor) or Mobile Phone (Xamarin) clients.

Device data will contain the following information:
- Id
- GroupId
- Timestamp
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Altitude
- Speed
